    <p>The three headings above are aligned center, left and right.</p>
    <p>The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.
        A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and
        the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers)</p>
